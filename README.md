**Statistical Analysis - Critical Role**
This is a  repository for statistical processing and analysis of data from www.critrolestats.com, a wonderful fan-made website which collects data from the popular Dungeons & Dragons show Critical Role. Currently, the respository just contains some basic data processing, as well as a chi squared test on Laura Bailey's distribution of rolls on a 20-sided die throughout the show.
